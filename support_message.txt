Subject: API Still Showing Unverified Status Despite Approval Email Received 6 Hours Ago

Hello Mobile Text Alerts Support,

I received an approval email approximately 6 hours ago confirming that my phone number verification was approved. However, I'm still unable to send custom messages via the API - all requests are being rejected with the following error:

Error: "Unverified accounts only can send template messages. Check the controlled-templates/global API endpoint for approved templates."
Error Type: no_url_allowed_error
HTTP Code: 403

Here are my account details:
- API Key: bed44f38-3873-5b65-8990-2743d5fa91e0
- Account Name: MyStartup
- Email: drew.deister@gmail.com
- Phone Number: +1 877 664 7380
- Longcode ID: 8337441549

When I check the dedicated numbers endpoint (/v3/dedicated-numbers), I see:
- "verified": 1 (general verification shows as complete)
- "tollFreeVerificationStatus": 0 (toll-free verification still shows as pending)

I'm trying to implement an auto-reply feature that sends "hi there!" when someone texts my number. The webhook is working correctly (I can receive messages), but I cannot send replies because the API still treats my account as unverified.

Could you please:
1. Check the verification status on your end
2. Confirm if the toll-free verification process is complete
3. Refresh/sync my verification status in the API system if needed

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
